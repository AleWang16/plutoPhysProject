# Clearing an Orbit
## A formal investigation into how Pluto tragically lost its planethood
### Collin Fitzpatrick, Alejandro Wang, Alan Wu

### Background
According to the International Astronomical Union, a celestial body must meet three criteria to be considered a planet.

1. It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun). 
2. It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. 
3. It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. 

### Goal
We would like to build a simulation that can model how a large planet object orbiting the sun interacts with smaller bodies in its path. 

Some questions we have include:
- How quickly is the orbit cleared?
- How big must the planet be relative to the bodies in order to clear the orbit?
- Where do the small bodies end up? As moons? Thrown out of solar system? Thrown into the planet or the sun?
